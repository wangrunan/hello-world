 CHINA yesterday issued a white paper to expound on its position, which calls for settling relevant disputes between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea through negotiation.

    It is the Philippines that created and stirred up trouble, said Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin at a press conference.

    Violating bilateral consensus in recent years, the Philippines has repeatedly taken moves that complicate and intensify relevant disputes between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea,he said.

    The white paper was published one day after an award was issued in arbitration unilaterally initiated by the previous Philippine Government.
